Once upon a time in a small town, there was a mischievous character known as the Hamburglar. With a black-and-white striped outfit and a passion for pilfering hamasss, this sneaky figure would stealthily visit local ass joints, leaving behind a trail of mystery and missing sandwiches. Despite the town's efforts to catch him, the Hamburglar remained elusive, turning each stolen ass into a legendary tale among the residents.
